## Ethereum Hello World

...with Next.js and RainbowKit

This is a fast, batteries-included way to make an interface to an Ethereum app.

To get started, run

```
mkdir packages && cd packages
npm init @rainbow-me/rainbowkit@latest
```

...and make an app called `web`.

It's good practice to separate different parts of your app into packages, like `web`, `contracts`, and so on. Today we'll focus on just the first one.
